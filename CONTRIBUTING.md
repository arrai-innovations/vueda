# Contributing to VUEDA

Thank you for contributing to VUEDA. The root [README](README.md) explains how
to install the workspace and run its checks and tests.

## Issue and pull request titles

A title should identify the affected behavior and the intended outcome. It
should remain useful in search results, release notes, and cross-references
after the original discussion has been forgotten.

Prefer an active verb and a concrete object. Avoid vague titles such as `Fix
bug`, `Updates`, or `Cleanup`. Do not end a title with a period. Include an
implementation detail only when that implementation is the public contract or
the point of the work.

### Issue titles

Phrase an issue title as the outcome that closing the issue will deliver. Do
not add a Conventional Commit prefix such as `fix:` or `feat:`. Issue types and
labels classify proposed work.

Use `Investigate` only when evidence gathering or a decision is itself the
deliverable.

Examples:

- `Reject invalid OpenAPI documents before publishing`
- `Preserve list filters when returning from detail`
- `Investigate duplicate webhook deliveries after retries`

### Pull request titles

Write a pull request title as the commit subject that should represent the
merged change:

```text
<type>(<optional-scope>): <outcome>
```

The allowed types are:

```text
build, ci, chore, content, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, remove, revert, style, test, wip
```

The scope should identify the affected filename (without its extension),
module, package, or concern. A scope is optional.

The text after the prefix must describe the concrete outcome, not merely
classify the work. The title should account for the whole branch.

Examples:

- `feat(server): support Django 6.1 and MAILERS`
- `fix(FormConfirmDialog): unmount wrappers after each test`
- `docs(configuration): explain MAILERS migration`

Avoid titles such as `fix: server changes` or `chore: updates`.

## Commit messages

Commit messages use the same Conventional Commit format, allowed types, and
scope guidance as pull request titles. Lefthook runs commitlint locally to
validate commit messages.
